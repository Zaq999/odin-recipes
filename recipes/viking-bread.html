            <h3>Description:</h3>
            <p> Bread was a <strong>staple</strong> of the diet, however, depending on where you lay in the village hierachy is what <strong>type</strong> of bread you ate.
                The slaves would eat <strong>flatbreads</strong> cooked on a griddle-type pan over a fire and use it similar to a plate. It would absorb the liquid from the stew and make it softer to eat. 
                Whereas, this bread which is slightly risen due to the bicarbonate of soda (baking soda) in it would have been for the <strong>richer</strong> Vikings. 
                The bread would have been torn and dipped into the stew or served with homemade butter and honey or jam for a sweeter dish.

            <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>5 cups plain (all purpose flour)</li>
                <li>1 tsp baking soda</li>
                <li>1 tsp salt</li>
                <li>3/4 cups of oats</li>
                <li>2 cups of warm water</li>
                <li>Oats to sprinkle on the top</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Steps:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Start by putting all of the dry ingredients in a bowl and mix together.</li>
                <li>Add in the warm water and use a wooden spoon (just like a Viking) to stir the ingredients to start to form a dough.</li>
                <li>When you canâ€™t stir any more turn it out onto a surface and knead with your hands until firm.</li>
                <li>Place on a lined baking tray and into an oven.</li>
                <li>With the bread on the tray in the oven switch it on to 180C (fan assisted) and set the timer for 45 minutes.</li>
                <li>Once cooked, remove, let cool a little and then enjoy!</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Notes:</h3>
            <p>You can serve this bread with <strong>butter and honey</strong>, but you could try making a stew like our <a href="../recipes/viking-stew.html">Viking Stew</a>
                to cook with kids and dipping the bread in that to soak up the liquid.</p>
